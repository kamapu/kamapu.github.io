[![GIVD](badges/swea_givd.svg)](http://www.givd.info/ID/AF-00-006)
[![version](badges/sweadataveg_version.svg)](sweadataveg.html)

This database was launched in the context of the [SWEA
project](https://www.ipe.uni-bonn.de/verbundprojekte/wetland/swea) (agricultural
use and vulnerability of small wetlands in East Africa) and has been its legacy
across different research projects in Eastern Africa. Currently covers several
countries in the African continent and diverse vegetation types.

The first mention to this database was done by [Alvarez et al.
(2012a)](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00092) and [Alvarez et al.
(2012b)](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00060).

This database was first launched as a vegetation-plot database for Chilean
grassland vegetation (**CL-Dataveg**; see also [Alvarez et al.
2012c](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00230)). Currently it is extended to other
countries in South America and is opened for any plant bio-diversity record and
any vegetation type.
