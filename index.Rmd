This page introduces you to my activities as docent, researcher and developer.
Maybe also some of my abilities as artist.

# Research Projects

Research and teaching activities are focused on plant diversity and vegetation
ecology in Eastern Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia).

  <b>GlobE-wetlands -- reconciling future food production with environmental
  protection: </b>
  
  An interdisciplinary project dealing with the effects of cropping activities
  on seasonal wetlands.
  While wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa are important sites for food production,
  especially in semi-arid regions, cropping activities may also have negative
  impacts on the integrity of agro-ecosystems.

  <b>RCR --  resilience, collapse and reorganization in social-ecological
  systems of African savannas:</b>
  
  Social systems and environment interact through coupling and regulation
  processes in the bio-physical, political-institutional and symbolic-cultural
  space.
  Understanding such processes may allow decision makers to adopt strategies
  suitables for avoiding collapse of socio-ecological systems (SES).
