**Miguel Alvarez, Dr. rer. nat.**

I am **Research Associate** at the [Plant Nutrition
Group](https://www.ipe.uni-bonn.de/), University of Bonn, Germany.
My research activities are focused on plant diversity and vegetation ecology
in East African wetlands.
Additionally, I dedicate some efforts to synsystematic classification in diverse
formations and in the management of data stored in vegetation-plot databases.
Some surveys have been also carried out in Mediterranean and temperate Chile.

This page is oriented to my services developing tools for handling
vegetation-plot data and diversity information.

Although most the information presented here is related to my work, it does not
represent in any way the opinion of the University of Bonn.
