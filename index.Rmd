This page introduces you to my activities as docent, researcher and developer.
Maybe also some of my abilities as artist.

# Research Projects

Research and teaching activities are focused on plant diversity and vegetation
ecology in Eastern Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia).

## Current Projects

  <td>
  **Future Rural Africa -- Future-making and social-ecological transformation:**
  
  Evaluating expectations and probabilities in future-making from different
  perspectives, including social and natural sciences.
  One of the focus in the consortium is related to the importance of
  **invasive plants** on the ecology and management of rangelands in Kenya.

  **GlobE-wetlands -- reconciling future food production with environmental
  protection:**
  
  An interdisciplinary project dealing with the effects of cropping activities
  on seasonal wetlands.
  While wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa are important sites for food production,
  especially in semi-arid regions, cropping activities may also have negative
  impacts on the integrity of agro-ecosystems.

  **RCR --  resilience, collapse and reorganization in social-ecological
  systems of African savannas:**
  
  Social systems and environment interact through coupling and regulation
  processes in the bio-physical, political-institutional and symbolic-cultural
  space.   Understanding such processes may allow decision makers to adopt
  strategies   suitables for avoiding collapse of socio-ecological systems
  (SES).
