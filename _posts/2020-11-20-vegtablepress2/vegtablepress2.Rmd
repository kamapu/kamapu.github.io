title: "Basics on the work with vegetation-plots in vegtable"
description: |
  The package vegtable was developed for the handling of data provided by
  vegetation-plot databases in single objects within R sessions.
  In this package functions attempt to encapsulate process of complex data sets
  in brief command-lines during an R session and target to repeatability in the
  assessment of floristic information.
  Here we review through some examples the use of the most important functions
  implemented in vegtable.
