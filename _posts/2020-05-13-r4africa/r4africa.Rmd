description: |
  The proliferation of freeware and open source applications expands the
  potential of scientists, especially in countries of difficult access to
  commercial licenses for software tools.
  In the context of enhanced international networks between education and
  research institutions, training on use of freeware is becoming a crucial step
  for a better balance in collaboration between European and Eastern African
  countries, harmonizing the capacities among researchers and students.
