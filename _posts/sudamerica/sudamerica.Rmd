The database **sudamerica** is formatted in **PostgreSQL**, including the
extension **PostGIS**.
**sudamerica** contains currently records from
**`r format(nrow(sam), big.mark=",")`** plot observations obtained from
**`r format(length(unique(sam$data_source)), big.mark=",")`** sources, most of
them published either as journal articles or monographs.
The oldest record was done in
**`r format(min(sam$record_date, na.rm=TRUE), "%d-%m-%Y")`**,
while the newest record is from
**`r format(max(sam$record_date, na.rm=TRUE), "%d-%m-%Y")`**.
