title: "Basics on the work with vegetation-plots in vegtable"
description: |
  The package vegtable was developed for the handling of data provided by
  vegetation-plot databases in single objects within R sessions.
  In this package functions attempt to encapsulate process of complex data sets
  in brief command-lines during an R session and target to repeatability in the
  assessment of floristic information.
  Here we review through some examples the use of the most important functions
  implemented in vegtable.

# Installation

Both packages [`taxlist`](https://docs.ropensci.org/taxlist/) and
[`vegtable`](https://github.com/kamapu/vegtable/) are released in the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**). Since `taxlist` is a dependency of
`vegtable`, both will be installed in the following command:

```{r installation1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegtable", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development versions from their repositories
at **GitHub**.

```{r installation2, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/taxlist", build_vignettes=TRUE)
install_github("kamapu/vegtable")
```

An additional package including some example data required for this session have
also to be installed from **GitHub**.

```{r installation3, eval=FALSE}
install_github("kamapu/datastore")
```

# Working with species lists only

Before starting with the work, do not forget to load the installed packages into
your R-session:

```{r load_pkgs}
library(vegtable)
library(datastore)
```

In this first section we focus on the `taxlist` objects, which are specialized
for handling taxonomic lists.
For more details on the theory behind this package, see @Alvarez2018.

The package `taxlist` includes a own data set formatted as a `taxlist` object.
You can get a general report on the content of this data set by using the
function `summary()`.

```{r summ_taxlist}
data(Easplist)
summary(Easplist)
```

The information stored in a `taxlist` object is organized in four
column-oriented tables following a relational model and allocated in own slots
within the object. The access to the respective slots in R is done with the
symbol `@` or alternatively using the function `slot()`.

```{r taxlist_model, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/taxlist_model.png")
```

```{r structure}
head(Easplist@taxonNames)
head(Easplist@taxonRelations)
head(Easplist@taxonTraits)
head(Easplist@taxonViews)
```

## Advanced displays

The function `summary()` can also be used to query information of a taxon or a
set of taxa. In such case we can add the name of the requested taxon usage name.
We can also specify a column of the slot **taxonViews** in the parameter
`secundum` in order to get more informatin on the respective taxon view as done
here:

```{r amaranthus}
summary(Easplist, "Amaranthus hybridus", secundum="secundum")
```

Additionally the function `print_name()` can be used to format scientific names
within interactive documents, for instance in combination with the package
`rmarkdown`. See the example by `example(print_name)`, which is printing in
different formats.

```{r print_name, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
example(print_name)
```

# Working with vegetation-plots

Further examples will be applied to a data set available at the installed
package `datastore`, which corresponds to plot observations in grassland and
semi-aquatic communities from Temuco, Chile.
This data set was originally published by @SanMartin1998 and is stored in the
database **sudamerica**
[https://kamapu.github.io/sudamerica/, see also @Alvarez2012].

```{r loading_grasslands}
data(grasslands)
summary(grasslands)
```

## Structure

Objects of class `vegtable` are structured into `r length(slotNames(Kenya_veg))`
slots, where the slots **species**, **header**, and **samples** are the
essential ones.

```{r vegtable_model, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/vegtable_diagram.png")
```

The taxonomic list is handled as a `taxlist` object and is located at the slot
**species**:

```{r species_slot}
summary(grasslands@species)
```

The slot **header** is simply a data frame including information related to
single plot observations, for instance size of the plot, record date, results
of soil analyses, etc.

```{r header_slot}
head(grasslands@header)
```

Records of species in plots are stored in slot **samples**. Against the
commonly used cross tables (species by plots or plots by species), this slot is
organized in columns (column-oriented table, a.k.a database list).

```{r samples_slot}
head(grasslands@samples)
```

The slot **coverconvert** have an own, homonymous class and is used as container
for cover conversion tables.
These tables can be used for conversion of cover codes, which will be done by
the function `transform()`.
The example on grasslands does not include cover conversion tables but the data
set installed with `vegtable` does it.

```{r coverconvert_slot}
summary(Kenya_veg@coverconvert)
```

The slot **relations** is a list of data frames that provide additional
information for classes of categorical variables stored in slot **header**.
These tables correspond to *pop-up tables* of **Turboveg 2**.

```{r relations_slot}
names(grasslands@relations)
head(grasslands@relations$community_type)
```

While in the header table such categorical variables may be cryptic, there is
an option to insert columns from relations into header by using
`relation2header()`.
By this way, yo do not only see a community id, which is just a number, but you
can also see the respective names of the plant communities that correspond to
the syntaxa assigned to the plots originally by the publication.

```{r relation2header}
grasslands <- relation2header(grasslands, "community_type")
head(grasslands@header)
```

## Statistics

The packages `vegtable` and `taxlist` are rather specialized on data
manipulation than on data analysis. Nevertheless some common descriptive
statistics and summaries that can be used for further statistical analyses are
implemented.

### Trait proportions

In this data set, for instance, life forms are inserted as attributes of the
recorded species.
Since this attribute is a categorical variable, summaries at the plot level can
only be done as proportions.
The function `trait_proportion()` is suitable for such kind of summaries.
Note that the best way to collect statistics calculated for plots is adding them
as new columns into the slot **header**, which is done by the option
`in_header=TRUE`.
Additionally, the option `weight="cover_percentage"` is indicating that the
cover percentage stored in the slot **samples** will be used as weight for the
respective life from classes.

```{r lf_proportions}
grasslands <- trait_proportion(trait="life_form", object=grasslands,
		head_var="ReleveID", include_nas=FALSE, weight="cover_percentage",
		in_header=TRUE)
```

By default, the function added at slot **header** one column per level in the
traits variable appending a suffix (default `_prop`).
Just to remind you, we used the function `relation2header()` in order to add the
names of the recorded communities in the slot **header**.

```{r annual_prop}
# Add community names to the header table
grasslands <- relation2header(grasslands, relation="community_type")

# Display mean values per plant communities
aggregate(annual_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, FUN=mean)

# The same information as boxplot
par(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)
boxplot(annual_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, horizontal=TRUE,
		xlab="Proportion of annuals", ylab="")
```

Before you continue, note that the first argument in the function is a `formula`
indicating on the left a response as left term (in this case the statistic
describing a categorical trait variable) and the factors as right terms
(grouping variables for the plots).
This kind of objects will be frequently used in functions dealing with
`vegtable` objects.

### Trait Statistics

For numerical taxonomic traits statistical parameters such as averages and
standard deviation can be calculated per plot.
For instance the data set `grasslands` is also including Ellenberg's indicator
values [see @Ellenberg2001], which were collected from @Ramirez1991 and
@SanMartin2003.

The calculation of trait statistics is done by the function `trait_stats()`.
In the parameter `FUN` we can use a statistical function such as `mean()` but
we can also define an statistic using the cover values as weights for the
calculation.
In this case we can calculate weighted means:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x_{i} \cdot w_{i}}}{\sum{w_{i}}}$$

Here $\bar{x}$ is the mean indicator figure for a plot, $x_{i}$ is the
indicator value of the *ith* species in this plot, and $w_{i}$ is the weight of
the same species (cover value) in the plot.
In R we define it as a function:

```{r weighted_mean}
weighted_mean <- function(x, w, ...) sum(x*w, ...)/sum(w, ...)
```

In the function `trait_stats()` we can query indicator figures through a
formula.
Note that this formula may include multiple variables on the left terms for the
simultaneous calculation of indicator values.

```{r trait_stats}
grasslands <- trait_stats(ind_n + ind_h ~ ReleveID, grasslands,
		FUN=weighted_mean,  include_nas=FALSE, weight="cover_percentage",
		suffix="_wmean", in_header=TRUE)
```

The resulting values may be useful to compare different plant communities or to
test relationships between different variables, for instance an expected
correlation between the humidity indicator and the proportion of annuals.

```{r H_graph1}
par(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)
boxplot(ind_h_wmean ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, horizontal=TRUE,
		xlab="H figure (weighted mean)", ylab="")
```

```{r H_graph2}
# Linear regression model
Mod <- lm(annual_prop ~ ind_h_wmean, data=grasslands@header)

# plot
plot(grasslands@header[,c("ind_h_wmean", "annual_prop")], xlab="H figure",
		ylab="Proportion of annuals", pch=20, col="darkgrey")
abline(Mod, lty=2, col="red")
```

Well, it is not a nice distribution of observations but still suggesting a
negative tendency in the proportion of annuals by increasing humidity
indicator, as expected.


### Statistics from taxonomic information

Taxonomic information (taxonomic ranks and parent-child relationships) are not
directly available for statistical descriptions in `taxlist` objects.
If we need to calculate proportions of determined genera or families in the
plots, we can pass the taxonomy to the taxon traits table with the function
`tax2traits()`.
You need to set `get_names=TRUE`, otherwise only taxon IDs (numbers) will be
inserted in the traits table.

```{r tax2traits}
grasslands@species <- tax2traits(grasslands@species, get_names=TRUE)
head(grasslands@species@taxonTraits)
```

Now we can compare, for instance, the proportion of species belonging to the
family Poaceae (grasses) in the different plant communities.

```{r tax_plot}
grasslands <- trait_proportion("family", grasslands, head_var="ReleveID",
		trait_level="Poaceae", include_nas=FALSE, weight="cover_percentage",
		in_header=TRUE)

# Compare communities by proportion of Poaceae
par(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)
boxplot(Poaceae_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header,
		horizontal=TRUE, xlab="Proportion of Poaceae", ylab="")
```

This graphic is advising us that maybe few of these communities can be
considered as grasslands *sensu stricto*.

The function `count_taxa()` is defined for calculation of number of taxa at
specific taxonomic ranks.
Note that this function may be smart enough to aggregate taxa into the
corresponding ranks, for instance the calculation of species numbers may also
include sub-specific taxa in their respective species (option
`include_lower=TRUE`).

```{r count_taxa}
grasslands <- count_taxa(species ~ ReleveID, grasslands, include_lower=TRUE,
		in_header=TRUE)

# Compare communities by species richness
par(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)
boxplot(species_count ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header,
		horizontal=TRUE, xlab="Species richness", ylab="")
```

## Cross tables and Maps

Most of the applications used for floristic comparisons require data in form of
a cross table.
Furthermore, species composition of communities may be more evident by
displaying data, for instance, in a table of species by plots.
To arrange data in such a way we can apply the function `crosstable()`.

In order to reduce the data set, we will apply the function `subset()`,
selecting plots of the association *Juncetum proceri*.

```{r subset}
juncetum <- subset(grasslands, community_name == "Juncetum proceri",
		slot="header")
summary(juncetum)
```

In the function `crosstable()` we indicate as formula in the left term the
numeric variable used to fill the table, the first right term is the group
variable used for the columns and the further right terms are group variables
defining the rows of the cross table.
Note that the taxa in the formula can be addressed by either one of two
keywords, namely **TaxonName** for the use of original entry names (taxon usage
names) or **AcceptedName** for use of the respective names considered as
accepted in slot species.
We also set the arguments `FUN=max` defining the function used to merge
multiple occurrences of a taxon in a plot and `na_to_zero=TRUE` to fill
absence.

```{r cross_table}
juncetum_cross <- crosstable(cover_percentage ~ ReleveID + AcceptedName,
		data=juncetum, FUN=max, na_to_zero=TRUE)
head(juncetum_cross)
```

When plots are geo-referenced, it is also possible to export the respective
locations as kml files to be displayed in **Google Earth** using the function
`vegtable2kml()`.

```{r kml, eval=FALSE}
vegtable2kml(grasslands, file="grasslands.kml", coords= ~ longitude + latitude)
```

Alternatively the locations of plots can be displayed by using the package
`leaflet`.

```{r leaflet, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(grasslands@header) %>% addTiles() %>%
		addCircleMarkers(lng=~longitude, lat=~latitude, color="red",
				opacity=0.3, radius=1)
```
