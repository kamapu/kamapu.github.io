Currently covers several countries in the African continent and diverse vegetation types.\nThe first mention to this database was done by Alvarez et al. (2012a) and Alvarez et al. (2012b).\nRead more…\nsudamerica\n \nThis database was first launched as a vegetation-plot database for Chilean grassland vegetation (CL-Dataveg; see also Alvarez et al. 2012c). Currently it is extended to other countries in South America and is opened for any plant bio-diversity record and any vegetation type.\nRead more…\n\n\n\n",

My research activities are focused on plant diversity and vegetation ecology in East African wetlands. Additionally, I dedicate some efforts to synsystematic classification in diverse formations and in the management of data stored in vegetation-plot databases. Some surveys have been also carried out in Mediterranean and temperate Chile.\n \nThis page is oriented to my services developing tools for handling vegetation-plot data and diversity information.\nAlthough most the information presented here is related to my work, it does not represent in any way the opinion of the University of Bonn.\nCurriculum Vitae\nPublication List\n\n\n\n",

While wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa are important sites for food production, especially in semi-arid regions, cropping activities may also have negative impacts on the integrity of agro-ecosystems.\n \nARBONETH\nARBONETH – The Ethiopian arboretum network\nResearch and education project supporting ex-situ conservation of native trees through the establishment of a network among Ethiopian arboretums.\n \nRCR\nRCR – Resilience, collapse and reorganization in social-ecological systems of African savannas\nSocial systems and environment interact through coupling and regulation processes in the bio-physical, political-institutional and symbolic-cultural space. Understanding such processes may allow decision makers to adopt strategies suitables for avoiding collapse of socio-ecological systems (SES).\n \nSWEA\nSWEA – Agricultural use and vulnerability of small wetlands in East Africa\nEffects of cropping activities on the integrity and productivity of small wetlands in Kenya and Tanzania.\n \nIMPETUS\nIMPETUS – An integrated approach to the efficient management of scarce water resources in West Africa\nSustainable management of water resources in Benin and Morocco.\n \n\n\n\n",
