By this way, yo do not only see a community id, which is just a number, but you can also see the respective names of the plant communities that correspond to the syntaxa assigned to the plots originally by the publication.\n\n\ngrasslands <- relation2header(grasslands, \"community_type\")\nhead(grasslands@header)\n\n\n    ReleveID data_source plot_size elevation community_type longitude\n669     1153          58        25       165            534  -72.6979\n670     1154          58        25       199            534  -72.7341\n671     1155          58        25       170            534  -72.6803\n672     1156          58        25        77            534  -72.7440\n673     1157          58        25       168            534  -72.6958\n674     1159          58        25       165            534  -72.6979\n    latitude   community_name\n669 -38.7072 Juncetum proceri\n670 -38.6310 Juncetum proceri\n671 -38.6908 Juncetum proceri\n672 -38.6846 Juncetum proceri\n673 -38.7141 Juncetum proceri\n674 -38.7072 Juncetum proceri\n\nStatistics\nThe packages vegtable and taxlist are rather specialized on data manipulation than on data analysis. Nevertheless some common descriptive statistics and summaries that can be used for further statistical analyses are implemented.\nTrait proportions\nIn this data set, for instance, life forms are inserted as attributes of the recorded species. Since this attribute is a categorical variable, summaries at the plot level can only be done as proportions. The function trait_proportion() is suitable for such kind of summaries. Note that the best way to collect statistics calculated for plots is adding them as new columns into the slot header, which is done by the option in_header=TRUE. Additionally, the option weight=\"cover_percentage\" is indicating that the cover percentage stored in the slot samples will be used as weight for the respective life from classes.\n\n\ngrasslands <- trait_proportion(trait=\"life_form\", object=grasslands,\n    head_var=\"ReleveID\", include_nas=FALSE, weight=\"cover_percentage\",\n    in_header=TRUE)\n\n\n\nBy default, the function added at slot header one column per level in the traits variable appending a suffix (default _prop). Just to remind you, we used the function relation2header() in order to add the names of the recorded communities in the slot header.\n\n\n# Add community names to the header table\ngrasslands <- relation2header(grasslands, relation=\"community_type\")\n\n# Display mean values per plant communities\naggregate(annual_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, FUN=mean)\n\n\n                                community_name annual_prop\n1                     Anthoxanthum utriculatum 0.007826989\n2                  Eleocharietum macrostachyae 0.096678841\n3                    Eleocharietum pachycarpae 0.092635324\n4        Eleocharis pachycarpa-Lythrum portula 0.173790650\n5  Gnaphalio cymatoidis-Polygonetum piperoidis 0.650889962\n6                             Juncetum proceri 0.001167405\n7             Junco proceri-Caricetum ripariae 0.000000000\n8   Ludwigia peploides-Sagittaria montevidense 0.000000000\n9       Mentho pulegium-Agrostietum capillaris 0.041020366\n10                             Phyla nodiflora 0.958893907\n\n# The same information as boxplot\npar(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)\nboxplot(annual_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, horizontal=TRUE,\n    xlab=\"Proportion of annuals\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nBefore you continue, note that the first argument in the function is a formula indicating on the left a response as left term (in this case the statistic describing a categorical trait variable) and the factors as right terms (grouping variables for the plots). This kind of objects will be frequently used in functions dealing with vegtable objects.\nTrait Statistics\nFor numerical taxonomic traits statistical parameters such as averages and standard deviation can be calculated per plot. For instance the data set grasslands is also including Ellenberg’s indicator values (see Ellenberg et al., 2001), which were collected from Ramírez et al. (1991) and San Martín et al. (2003).\nThe calculation of trait statistics is done by the function trait_stats(). In the parameter FUN we can use a statistical function such as mean() but we can also define an statistic using the cover values as weights for the calculation. In this case we can calculate weighted means:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x_{i} \\cdot w_{i}}}{\\sum{w_{i}}}\\]\nHere \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean indicator figure for a plot, \\(x_{i}\\) is the indicator value of the ith species in this plot, and \\(w_{i}\\) is the weight of the same species (cover value) in the plot. In R we define it as a function:\n\n\nweighted_mean <- function(x, w, ...) sum(x*w, ...)/sum(w, ...)\n\n\n\nIn the function trait_stats() we can query indicator figures through a formula. Note that this formula may include multiple variables on the left terms for the simultaneous calculation of indicator values.\n\n\ngrasslands <- trait_stats(ind_N + ind_H ~ ReleveID, grasslands,\n    FUN=weighted_mean,  include_nas=FALSE, weight=\"cover_percentage\",\n    suffix=\"_wmean\", in_header=TRUE)\n\n\n\nThe resulting values may be useful to compare different plant communities or to test relationships between different variables, for instance an expected correlation between the humidity indicator and the proportion of annuals.\n\n\npar(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)\nboxplot(ind_H_wmean ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header, horizontal=TRUE,\n    xlab=\"H figure (weighted mean)\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Linear regression model\nMod <- lm(annual_prop ~ ind_H_wmean, data=grasslands@header)\n\n# plot\nplot(grasslands@header[,c(\"ind_H_wmean\", \"annual_prop\")], xlab=\"H figure\",\n    ylab=\"Proportion of annuals\", pch=20, col=\"darkgrey\")\nabline(Mod, lty=2, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nWell, it is not a nice distribution of observations but still suggesting a negative tendency in the proportion of annuals by increasing humidity indicator, as expected.\nStatistics from taxonomic information\nTaxonomic information (taxonomic ranks and parent-child relationships) are not directly available for statistical descriptions in taxlist objects. If we need to calculate proportions of determined genera or families in the plots, we can pass the taxonomy to the taxon traits table with the function tax2traits(). You need to set get_names=TRUE, otherwise only taxon IDs (numbers) will be inserted in the traits table.\n\n\ngrasslands@species <- tax2traits(grasslands@species, get_names=TRUE)\nhead(grasslands@species@taxonTraits)\n\n\n   TaxonConceptID origin_status life_form ind_L ind_T ind_R ind_N\n9           21253        native      <NA>     8    NA     5     5\n20          23006        native      <NA>     9     6     3     3\n32          12288     adventive    annual     9     5     7     6\n35          16407     adventive    annual     8     6     7     8\n39          20972     adventive perennial     7     5     3     4\n41          22569     adventive perennial     9     5     6     8\n   ind_H ind_S                           variety\n9      9    NA Symphyotrichum vahlii var. vahlii\n20    10    NA                              <NA>\n32     4    NA                              <NA>\n35     4    NA                              <NA>\n39    NA    NA                              <NA>\n41    10    NA                              <NA>\n                   subspecies                  species          genus\n9                        <NA>    Symphyotrichum vahlii Symphyotrichum\n20 Carex fuscula ssp. fuscula            Carex fuscula          Carex\n32                       <NA>              Briza minor          Briza\n35                       <NA>          Cirsium vulgare        Cirsium\n39                       <NA>      Agrostis capillaris       Agrostis\n41                       <NA> Alisma plantago-aquatica         Alisma\n         family\n9    Compositae\n20   Cyperaceae\n32      Poaceae\n35   Compositae\n39      Poaceae\n41 Alismataceae\n\nNow we can compare, for instance, the proportion of species belonging to the family Poaceae (grasses) in the different plant communities.\n\n\ngrasslands <- trait_proportion(\"family\", grasslands, head_var=\"ReleveID\",\n    trait_level=\"Poaceae\", include_nas=FALSE, weight=\"cover_percentage\",\n    in_header=TRUE)\n\n# Compare communities by proportion of Poaceae\npar(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)\nboxplot(Poaceae_prop ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header,\n    horizontal=TRUE, xlab=\"Proportion of Poaceae\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nThis graphic is advising us that maybe few of these communities can be considered as grasslands sensu stricto.\nThe function count_taxa() is defined for calculation of number of taxa at specific taxonomic ranks. Note that this function may be smart enough to aggregate taxa into the corresponding ranks, for instance the calculation of species numbers may also include sub-specific taxa in their respective species (option include_lower=TRUE).\n\n\ngrasslands <- count_taxa(species ~ ReleveID, grasslands, include_lower=TRUE,\n    in_header=TRUE)\n\n# Compare communities by species richness\npar(mar=c(5, 20, 1, 1), las=1)\nboxplot(species_count ~ community_name, data=grasslands@header,\n    horizontal=TRUE, xlab=\"Species richness\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nCross tables and Maps\nMost of the applications used for floristic comparisons require data in form of a cross table. Furthermore, species composition of communities may be more evident by displaying data, for instance, in a table of species by plots. To arrange data in such a way we can apply the function crosstable().\nIn order to reduce the data set, we will apply the function subset(), selecting plots of the association Juncetum proceri.\n\n\njuncetum <- subset(grasslands, community_name == \"Juncetum proceri\",\n    slot=\"header\")\nsummary(juncetum)\n\n\n## Metadata \n   object size: 202.9 Kb \n   validity: TRUE \n\n## Content \n   number of plots: 15 \n   plots with records: 15 \n   variables in header: 16 \n   number of relations: 2 \n\n## Taxonomic List \n   taxon names: 544 \n   taxon concepts: 197 \n   validity: TRUE \n\nIn the function crosstable() we indicate as formula in the left term the numeric variable used to fill the table, the first right term is the group variable used for the columns and the further right terms are group variables defining the rows of the cross table. Note that the taxa in the formula can be addressed by either one of two keywords, namely TaxonName for the use of original entry names (taxon usage names) or AcceptedName for use of the respective names considered as accepted in slot species. We also set the arguments FUN=max defining the function used to merge multiple occurrences of a taxon in a plot and na_to_zero=TRUE to fill absence.\n\n\njuncetum_cross <- crosstable(cover_percentage ~ ReleveID + AcceptedName,\n    data=juncetum, FUN=max, na_to_zero=TRUE)\nhead(juncetum_cross)\n\n\n                         AcceptedName 1147 1148 1157 1158 1159 1161\n1    Adesmia corymbosa var. corymbosa   10  0.5  0.5  0.5  0.5  0.5\n2                 Agrostis capillaris   15 40.0 10.0 20.0 30.0  0.0\n3            Anthoxanthum utriculatum    0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n4 Arrhenatherum elatius var. bulbosum    0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n5                Baccharis sagittalis    0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n6               Centipeda elatinoides    0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0\n  1149 1150 1151 1152 1153 1154 1155 1156 1160\n1    0    0  0.0    0    0    0    0  0.0  0.0\n2   10   30 20.0   20   50   50   50 20.0 40.0\n3    0    0  0.0    0    0    0    0  0.5  0.0\n4    0    0  0.0    0    0    0    0  0.5  0.0\n5    0    0  0.0    0    0    0    0  0.0  0.5\n6    0    0  0.5    0    0    0    0  0.0  0.0\n\nWhen plots are geo-referenced, it is also possible to export the respective locations as kml files to be displayed in Google Earth using the function vegtable2kml().\n\n\nvegtable2kml(grasslands, file=\"grasslands.kml\", coords= ~ longitude + latitude)\n\n\n\nAlternatively the locations of plots can be displayed by using the package leaflet.\n\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet(grasslands@header) %>% addTiles() %>%\n    addCircleMarkers(lng=~longitude, lat=~latitude, color=\"red\",\n        opacity=0.3, radius=1)\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"http://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addCircleMarkers\",\"args\":[[-38.7072,-38.631,-38.6908,-38.6846,-38.7141,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7342,-38.7138,-38.7138,-38.7138,-38.6908,-38.6908,-38.6908,-38.631,-38.631,-38.631,-38.6379,-38.6727,-38.6908,-38.7141,-38.7342,-38.7342,-38.6727,-38.6846,-38.6846,-38.6846,-38.6846,-38.6985,-38.6908,-38.6846,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7342,-38.6985,-38.6985,-38.6985,-38.631,-38.631,-38.631,-38.6908,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7141,-38.7342,-38.7342,-38.7342,-38.631,-38.6379,-38.6908,-38.6908,-38.7342,-38.6727,-38.6727,-38.6727,-38.6727,-38.6846,-38.6846,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.6985,-38.6985,-38.6985,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.7072,-38.631,-38.6379,-38.6379,-38.6727],[-72.6979,-72.7341,-72.6803,-72.744,-72.6958,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6381,-72.684,-72.684,-72.684,-72.6803,-72.6803,-72.6803,-72.7341,-72.7341,-72.7341,-72.7324,-72.7201,-72.6803,-72.6958,-72.6381,-72.6381,-72.7201,-72.744,-72.744,-72.744,-72.744,-72.7093,-72.6803,-72.744,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6381,-72.7093,-72.7093,-72.7093,-72.7341,-72.7341,-72.7341,-72.6803,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6958,-72.6381,-72.6381,-72.6381,-72.7341,-72.7324,-72.6803,-72.6803,-72.6381,-72.7201,-72.7201,-72.7201,-72.7201,-72.744,-72.744,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.7093,-72.7093,-72.7093,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.6979,-72.7341,-72.7324,-72.7324,-72.7201],1,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"className\":\"\",\"stroke\":true,\"color\":\"red\",\"weight\":5,\"opacity\":0.3,\"fill\":true,\"fillColor\":\"red\",\"fillOpacity\":0.2},null,null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[-38.7342,-38.631],\"lng\":[-72.744,-72.6381]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nAcknowledgement\nThe data sets and routines demonstrated here have been previously tested by Elena Gómez in the context of her thesis for the degree of MSc.

Following software will be required for this session:\nR\nRStudio\nTurboveg\nJuice\nGoogle Earth\nInstallation of requirements in R\nThough all required R-packages will be installed in the computer room previous to this session, here there are instructions, in the case you try to repeat the sessions in your own computer. Following command line should be executed in order to install all required packages in R:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"foreign\", \"plotKML\", \"rgdal\", \"sp\", \"vegdata\",\n  \"vegan\", \"xlsx\"), dependencies=TRUE)\n\n\n\nThis session will focus on the use of two packages that use GitHub as repository for sharing and development. The package taxlist processes taxonomic lists that may be connected to biodiversity information (e.g. vegetation relevés), while the package vegtable has a similar task but handling vegetation-plot records. Since vegtable is depending on taxlist, both packages should be installed and updated for this session:\n\n\nlibrary(remotes)\ninstall_github(\"ropensci/taxlist\", build_vignettes=TRUE)\ninstall_github(\"kamapu/vegtable\", build_vignettes=TRUE)\n\n\n\nSince both package are been uploaded in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), you can also use the common way to get the last released version.\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"vegtable\", dependencies=TRUE)\n\n\n\nDocuments and data sets\nThis is the main document of the Workshop and will be distributed among its participants. Additionally, data sets required for the examples are provided by the installation of the R-packages taxlist and vegtable.\nIntroduction to taxlist\nThe package taxlist define an homonymous S4 class. Among other properties, S4 classes implement a formal definition of objects, tests for their validation and functions (methods) applied to them. Such properties are suitable for structure information of taxonomic lists and for data handling.\n\n\nlibrary(taxlist)\nshowClass(\"taxlist\")\n\n\n\nThis class is composed by four slots, corresponding to column-oriented tables (class data.frame in R). While the slots taxonNames and taxonRelations contain the information on names (labels of taxon concepts) and taxon concepts, respectively, representing the core information of taxonomic lists.\nmost important information regarding taxa (taxon concepts), information in slots taxonTraits and taxonViews is optional and they can be empty.\nBuilding taxlist objects\nBuilding taxlist objects can be achieved either through a step-by-step routine working with small building blocks or by importing consolidated data sets.\nUsing character vectors\nObjects of class taxlist can be just built from a list of names formatted as a character vector. To achieve it, the functions new and add_concept are required.\n\n\nplants <- c(\"Lactuca sativa\",\"Solanum tuberosum\",\"Triticum sativum\")\nsplist <- new(\"taxlist\")\nsplist <- add_concept(splist, plants)\nsummary(splist)\n\n\n\nUsing formatted tables\nIn the case of consolidated species lists, they can be inserted in a table previously formatted for taxlist (or Turboveg). Such tables can include both, accepted names for plant species as well as their respective synonyms. A formatted table is installed in the package taxlist.\n\n\nFile <- file.path(path.package(\"taxlist\"), \"cyperus\", \"names.csv\")\nCyperus <- read.csv(File, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)\nstr(Cyperus)\n\n\n\nThis table was originally imported form Turboveg and inherits some of its default columns. Four columns were renamed and are mandatory for process the table with the function df2taxlist:\nTaxonUsageID is the key field of a table of names (slot taxonNames).\nTaxonConceptID is the link of the name to its respective concept (key field in slot taxonRelations.\nTaxonName is the name itself as character.\nAuthorName is a character value indicating the author(s) of the respective name.\nAdditionally the functions require a logical vector indicating, which of those names should be considered as synonyms or accepted names for its respective concept. This information is provided by the inverse value of the column SYNONYM in Turboveg.\n\n\nCyperus <- df2taxlist(Cyperus, !Cyperus$SYNONYM)\nsummary(Cyperus)\n\n\nobject size: 32.1 Kb \nvalidation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE \n\nnumber of taxon usage names: 95 \nnumber of taxon concepts: 42 \ntrait entries: 0 \nnumber of trait variables: 0 \ntaxon views: 0 \n\nUsing Turboveg species list\nA direct import from a Turboveg database can be done using the function tv2taxlist. The installation of vegtable includes data published by Fujiwara et al. (2014) with vegetation plots collected in forest stands from Kenya.\n\n\nlibrary(vegtable)\ntv_home <- file.path(path.package(\"vegtable\"), \"tv_data\")\nFujiwara <- tv2taxlist(\"Fujiwara_sp\", tv_home)\nsummary(Fujiwara)\n\n\n\nSummary displays\nFor taxlist objects there are basically two ways for displaying summaries. The first way is just ot apply the function summary to a taxlist object:\n\n\nsummary(Cyperus)\n\n\nobject size: 32.1 Kb \nvalidation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE \n\nnumber of taxon usage names: 95 \nnumber of taxon concepts: 42 \ntrait entries: 0 \nnumber of trait variables: 0 \ntaxon views: 0 \n\nNote that this option also executes a validity check of the object, as done by the function validObject.\nThe second way is getting information on a particular concept by adding it concept ID or a taxon usage name as second argument in the function.\n\n\nsummary(Cyperus, \"Cyperus dives\")\n\n\n------------------------------ \nconcept ID: 197 \nview ID: none \nlevel: none \nparent: none \n\n# accepted name: \n197 Cyperus dives Delile \n\n# synonyms (5): \n52000 Cyperus immensus C.B. Clarke \n52600 Cyperus exaltatus var. dives (Delile) C.B. Clarke \n52601 Cyperus alopecuroides var. dives Boeckeler \n52602 Cyperus immensus var. petherickii (C.B. Clarke) Kük. \n52603 Cyperus petherickii C.B. Clarke \n------------------------------ \n\nSpecific information for several concepts can be displayed by using a vector with several concept IDs. Through the option ConceptID=\"all\" it is also possible to get a display of the first concepts, depending on the value of the argument maxsum.\n\n\nsummary(Cyperus, \"all\", maxsum=10)\n\n\n\nExample data set\nThe installation of taxlist includes the data Easplist, which is formatted as a taxlist object. This data is a subset of the species list used by the database SWEA-Dataveg (GIVD ID AF-006):\n\n\ndata(Easplist)\nsummary(Easplist)\n\n\n\nAccess to slots\nThe common ways to access to the content of slots in S4 objects are either using the function slot(object, name) or the symbol @ (i.e. object@name). Additional functions, which are specific for taxlist objects are taxon_names, taxon_relations, taxon_traits and taxon_views (see the help documentation).\nAdditionally, it is possible to use the methods $ and [ , the first for access to information in the slot taxonTraits, while the second can be also used for other slots in the object.\n\n\nsummary(as.factor(Easplist$lf_behn_2018))\n\n\n  acropleustophyte        chamaephyte     climbing_plant facultative_annual \n                 8                 25                 25                 20 \n   obligate_annual       phanerophyte   pleustohelophyte         reed_plant \n               114                 26                  8                 14 \n     reptant_plant      tussock_plant               NA's \n                19                 52               3576 \n\nSubsets\nMethods for the function subset are implemented in order to generate subsets of the content of taxlist objects. Such subsets usually apply pattern matching (for character vectors) or logical operations and are analogous to query building in relational databases. The subset method can be apply to any slot by setting the value of the argument slot.\n\n\nPapyrus <- subset(Easplist, grepl(\"papyrus\", TaxonName), slot=\"names\")\nsummary(Papyrus, \"all\")\n\n\n\nOr the very same results:\n\n\nPapyrus <- subset(Easplist, TaxonConceptID == 206, slot=\"relations\")\nsummary(Papyrus, \"all\")\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can look for a specific name.\n\n\nPhraaus <- subset(Easplist, charmatch(\"Phragmites australis\", TaxonName),\n  slot=\"names\")\nsummary(Phraaus, \"all\")\n\n\n\nParent-child relationships\nObjects belonging to the class taxlist can optionally content parent-child relationships and taxonomic levels. Such information is also included in the data Easplist, as shown in the summary output.\n\n\nsummary(Easplist)\n\n\nobject size: 761.4 Kb \nvalidation of 'taxlist' object: TRUE \n\nnumber of taxon usage names: 5393 \nnumber of taxon concepts: 3887 \ntrait entries: 311 \nnumber of trait variables: 1 \ntaxon views: 3 \n\nconcepts with parents: 3698 \nconcepts with children: 1343 \n\nhierarchical levels: form < variety < subspecies < species < complex < genus < family \nnumber of concepts in level form: 2\nnumber of concepts in level variety: 95\nnumber of concepts in level subspecies: 71\nnumber of concepts in level species: 2521\nnumber of concepts in level complex: 1\nnumber of concepts in level genus: 1011\nnumber of concepts in level family: 186\n\nNote that such information can get lost once applied subset, since the respective parents or children from the original data set are not anymore in the subset. May you like to recover parents and children, you can use the functions get_paretns or get_children, respectively.\n\n\nsummary(Papyrus, \"all\")\n\n\n------------------------------ \nconcept ID: 206 \nview ID: 1 \nlevel: species \nparent: none \n\n# accepted name: \n206 Cyperus papyrus L. \n\n# synonyms (2): \n52612 Cyperus papyrus ssp. antiquorum (Willd.)

They are defined in the homonymous package, while the species list will be required as a taxlist object.\nAs already mentioned, S4 objects are composed by slots:\n\n\nlibrary(vegtable)\nshowClass(\"vegtable\")\n\n\n\nThe information contained in the slot is the following:\ndescription is containing the “metadata” of the database as a named character vector.\nsamples is a column oriented table with the observations of species (as usage IDs) in plots and layers.\nheader is a table containing information on the plots.\nspecies is the taxonmic list as taxlist object.\nrelations are tables linked to categorical variables in slot header (called popups in Turboveg).\ncoverconvert is a list with conversion tables among cover scales.\nBuilding vegtable objects\nAn empty object (prototype) can be generated by using the function new:\n\n\nVeg <- new(\"vegtable\")\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to build an object from cross tables, assuming all species included in the table are accepted names:\n\n\nFile <- file.path(path.package(\"vegtable\"), \"Fujiwara_2014\", \"samples.csv\")\nFujiwara <- read.csv(File, check.names=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)\nFujiwara_veg <-df2vegtable(Fujiwara, 1, 2)\nsummary(Fujiwara_veg)\n\n\n\nExample data set\nThe package vegtable also provides own data sets as examples. One of those examples is dune_veg, which contains the data sets dune and dune.env from the package vegan.\n\n\ndata(dune_veg)\nsummary(dune_veg)\n\n\n\nOther example is Kenya_veg, which also represent a subset of the database SWEA-Dataveg (GIVD ID AF-00-006).\n\n\ndata(Kenya_veg)\nsummary(Kenya_veg)\n\n\n## Metadata \ndb_name: Sweadataveg\nsp_list: Easplist\ndictionary: Swea\nobject size: 9500.8 Kb \nvalidity: TRUE \n\n## Content \nnumber of plots: 1946 \nvariables in header: 34 \nnumber of relations: 3 \n\n## Taxonomic List \ntaxon names: 3164 \ntaxon concepts: 2392 \nvalidity: TRUE \n\nAs shown in the previous commands, the function summary displays a general overview of the object’s content, while it also runs a validity check. An additional display is offered by the function vegtable_stat:\n\n\nvegtable_stat(Kenya_veg)\n\n\n## Metadata \ndb_name: Sweadataveg\nsp_list: Easplist\ndictionary: Swea\nobject size: 9500.8 Kb \nvalidity: TRUE \n\n## Content \nnumber of plots: 1946 \nvariables in header: 34 \nnumber of relations: 3 \n\n## Taxonomic List \ntaxon names: 3164 \ntaxon concepts: 2392 \nvalidity: TRUE \n\nREFERENCES \nPrimary references: 5\n\n## AREA \nArea range (m^2): 150 - 1750\n<1 m^2: 0%\n1-<10 m^2: 0%\n10-<100 m^2: 0%\n100-<1000 m^2: 2%\n1000-<10000 m^2: 1%\n>=10000 m^2: 0%\nunknow: 97%\n\n## TIME \noldest: 1983 - youngest: 2014\n<=1919: 0%\n1920-1929: 0%\n1930-1939: 0%\n1940-1949: 0%\n1950-1959: 0%\n1960-1969: 0%\n1970-1979: 0%\n1980-1989: 36%\n1990-1999: 31%\n2000-2009: 2%\n2010-2019: 1%\nunknow: 30%\n\n## DISTRIBUTION \nKE: 100%\n\n## PERFORMANCE \n01: 83%\n02: 17%\n03: 0%\n04: 0%\n05: 0%\n06: 0%\n07: 0%\n08: 0%\n09: 0%\n10: 0%\n11: 0%\n12: 0%\n\nAccess to slots\nSome functions are provided for the access to slots of vegtable objects, namely header and veg_relation, taxon_traits and taxon_views (see the help documentation).\nFor a direct access of the content included in slot header, there are the methods $ and [:\n\n\nsummary(Kenya_veg$REFERENCE)\nveg_relation(Kenya_veg, \"REFERENCE\")[,1:3]\n\n\n\nSubsets\nAs a way to generate queries from vegtable objects, a method for the function subset is implemented as well. Following is the case of the data set dune_veg generating a subset with pasture plots.\n\n\ndata(dune_veg)\npasture <- subset(dune_veg, Use == \"Pasture\")\nsummary(dune_veg)\n\n\n## Metadata \nobject size: 22.1 Kb \nvalidity: TRUE \n\n## Content \nnumber of plots: 20 \nvariables in header: 6 \nnumber of relations: 0 \n\n## Taxonomic List \ntaxon names: 30 \ntaxon concepts: 30 \nvalidity: TRUE \n\nsummary(pasture)\n\n\n## Metadata \nobject size: 19.2 Kb \nvalidity: TRUE \n\n## Content \nnumber of plots: 5 \nvariables in header: 6 \nnumber of relations: 0 \n\n## Taxonomic List \ntaxon names: 30 \ntaxon concepts: 30 \nvalidity: TRUE \n\nCross tables\nMost of the applications dealing with analysis of vegetation tables (e.g. the package vegan) will deal with cross tables rather than with column-oriented database lists. Therefore a function crosstable is defined for the conversion of taxlist objects to cross tables. Before building a cross table it will be recommended to transform the cover into percentage value by using the function transform.\n\n\npasture <- transform(pasture, to=\"Cover\", rule=\"middle\")\n\nCross <- crosstable(Cover ~ ReleveID + AcceptedName, pasture, max,\n  na_to_zero=TRUE)\nCross\n\n\n\nThe first argument in the function is the formula y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xn, where:\ny is the cover value (a column in slot samples).\nx1 is the plot ID or a grouping value from slot header which will be used as columns in the cross table.\nx2 is the output for species (either TaxonName or AcceptedName).\nx3 to xn are additional information for the rows, such as layer, etc.\nThe second argument is the vegtable object and the third is a function, which will be applied in the case of multiple values in a cell (e.g. multiple records of a species within a plot).\nNote that there is also a method dealing with class data.frame (see the help documentation).\n\n\ndune_veg <- transform(dune_veg, to=\"Cover\", rule=\"middle\")\n\nCross_use <- crosstable(Cover ~ Use + AcceptedName, dune_veg, sum,\n  na_to_zero=TRUE)\nCross_use\n\n\n\nWhile the previous commands show statistics of groups in a vegetation table, it is also possible to write a presence-absence table:\n\n\nCross_pa <- crosstable(Cover ~ ReleveID + AcceptedName, pasture, function(x) 1,\n  na_to_zero=TRUE)\nCross_pa\n\n\n\nImport from Turboveg\nThe original task of vegtable was the import of Turboveg databases in R. Thus one of the oldest functions in the package is tv2vegtable.\n\n\ntv_home <- file.path(path.package(\"vegtable\"), \"tv_data\")\nFujiwara <- tv2vegtable(\"Fujiwara_2014\", tv_home)\n\n\nzero values will be replaced by NAs \n\nsummary(Fujiwara)\n\n\n## Metadata \ndb_name: Fujiwara_2014\nsp_list: Fujiwara_sp\ndictionary: Swea\nobject size: 392.6 Kb \nvalidity: TRUE \n\n## Content \nnumber of plots: 56 \nvariables in header: 29 \nnumber of relations: 2 \n\n## Taxonomic List \ntaxon names: 301 \ntaxon concepts: 254 \nvalidity: TRUE \n\nScreenshot of Kenyan data set displayed in TurbovegIn the case there is an error message produced by inconsistent data structure, there is the possibility of importing the data as a list for further inspection.\n\n\nFujiwara_list <- tv2vegtable(\"Fujiwara_2014\", tv_home, output=\"list\")\n\n\n\nExport to Juice\nExport of data for Juice follows a similar procedure as for cross tables.\n\n\nwrite_juice(Fujiwara, \"RiftValley\",\n  COVER_CODE ~ ReleveID + AcceptedName + LAYER,\n  header=c(\"TABLE_NR\",\"NR_IN_TAB\",\"ALTITUDE\",\"INCLINATIO\",\"EXPOSITION\",\n    \"COMM_TYPE\"),\n  FUN=paste0)\n\n\n\nBesides the vegtable object, the most important elements to export are:\nformula indicating how to construct the cross table.\nheader to show which variables should be exported for the head data.\ncoords with the names of coordinates, if present.\nFUN the function used for aggregate multiple records.\nThe values for coords should be as decimal degrees and in the spatial system WGS 84. In Juice such information will be included in the header data as columns deg_lon and deg_lat, allowing the display of plots in Google Earth. The previous command has generated two files, namely RiftValley_table.txt and RiftValley_header.txt.\nFor importing the table, you may follow the steps:\nOpen Juice\nIn menu File -> Import -> Table -> From Spreadsheet File (e.g. EXCEL Table)\nBrowse to RiftValley_table.txt and Open\nIn the last step, select the option Braun-Blanquet Codes and Finish\nFinally, save the new file\nThe Kenyan data set displayed in JuiceNow for the head:\nIn menu File -> Import -> Header Data -> From Comma Delimited File\nBrowse to RiftValley_header.txt and Open\nDisplay of header data in JuiceExport Locations to Google Earth\nIn those cases where vegetation data is geo-referenced, it is also possible to include spatial reference systems different than longlat WGS 84, which will be reprojected by the function.\n\n\nvegtable2kml(Fujiwara, \"RiftValley.kml\")\n\n\n\nLocation of plots displayed in Google EarthThen, hopefully you enjoyed the session and did not get too much error messages. \nAknowledgements: This workshop was supported by the project GlobE-wetlands.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This article assesses vegetation-plots from two localities (one Tanzanian site and one Kenyan site) with a supervised classification method (Cocktail) and includes an exhaustive review on previous syntaxonomical works. One of the localities (Kwasunga in Tanzania) appears in the cover page of the issue. Wetland ecosystems are important providers of services for the people and fulfil essential ecological functions. Syntaxonomic classifications according to species composition and ecological preferences are useful references for monitoring of integrity and to assess the importance of wetlands for conservation purposes.\n \nAlthough in this article I am the only author, I was not alone in the journey. I have to thank Ulrich Deil (University of Freiburg, Germany) for allowing me to access his personal library, Milan Chytrý (University of Brno, Czech Republic) for mentoring me on the hard way of doing Cocktail, and to Jan Roleček (Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic) for his support as editor. I also have to thank to two anonymous reviewers of the manuscript and all Kenyan and Tanzanian colleagues that supported me during the field activities.\n\n\n\n",
