  <b>Miguel Alvarez, Dr. rer. nat.</b>
  
  I am <b>Research Associate</b> at the
  <a href="https://www.ipe.uni-bonn.de/">Plant Nutrition Group</a>,
  University of Bonn, Germany.
  My research activities are focused on plant diversity and vegetation ecology
  in East African wetlands. Additionally, I dedicate some efforts to
  synsystematic classification in diverse formations and in the management of
  data stored in vegetation-plot databases. Some surveys have been also carried
  out in Mediterranean and temperate Chile.
  
  This page is oriented to my services developing tools for handling
  vegetation-plot data and diversity information.
  
  Although most the information presented here is related to my work, it does
  not represent in any way the opinion of the University of Bonn.

  **Future Rural Africa -- Future-making and social-ecological transformation:**
  
  Evaluating expectations and probabilities in future-making from different
  perspectives, including social and natural sciences.   One of the focus in the
consortium is related to the importance of   **invasive plants** on the ecology
and management of rangelands in Kenya.

  **GlobE-wetlands -- reconciling future food production with environmental
  protection:**
  
  An interdisciplinary project dealing with the effects of cropping activities
  on seasonal wetlands.   While wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa are important sites
for food production,   especially in semi-arid regions, cropping activities may
also have negative   impacts on the integrity of agro-ecosystems.

  **RCR --  resilience, collapse and reorganization in social-ecological
  systems of African savannas:**
  
  Social systems and environment interact through coupling and regulation
  processes in the bio-physical, political-institutional and symbolic-cultural
  space.   Understanding such processes may allow decision makers to adopt
  strategies   suitables for avoiding collapse of socio-ecological systems
  (SES).   [Read more...](http://resilience-research.de)
