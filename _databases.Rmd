Two main areas have been the focus of data collection in our working group,
namely the western side of South America and the central part of Africa.

This database was launched in the context of the [SWEA
project](https://www.ipe.uni-bonn.de/verbundprojekte/wetland/swea) (agricultural
use and vulnerability of small wetlands in East Africa) and has been its legacy
across different research projects in Eastern Africa.
Currently covers several countries in the African continent and diverse
vegetation types.

The first mention to this database was done by [Alvarez et al.
(2012a)](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00092) and [Alvarez et al.
(2012b)](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00060).

This database was first launched as a vegetation-plot database for
Chilean grassland vegetation (**CL-Dataveg**; see also
[Alvarez et al. 2012c](https://doi.org/10.7809/b-e.00230)). Currently it is
extended to other countries in South America and is opened for any plant
bio-diversity record and any vegetation type.
