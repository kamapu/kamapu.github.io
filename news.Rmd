# Package taxlist launched in CRAN
*2017-06-14*

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/taxlist)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=taxlist)
[![CRAN_downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/taxlist)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxlist/index.html)

After a long time of conceptualization and development, `taxlist` is already
available at **CRAN**.
Thus you can install it in your **R** session:

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("taxlist", dependencies=TRUE)
```

To load the last version from **GitHub** you can still use:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/taxlist")
```

Examples of its use will be published in
[Workshops](https://kamapu.github.io/workshops.html)
