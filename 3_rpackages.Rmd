A series of packages have been developed as experimental tools for data process
and analysis.
Though some of the created packages are developed for tasks specific to
personal projects, they are freely available for public use.

This package provides an object class for containing taxonomic lists.
Lists of taxa (e.g. plant species) may be a list of accepted names but can
optionally contain synonyms, taxonomic ranks, parent-child relationships, taxon
traits, etc.

The object `taxlist` attempts to validate the congruency of information
contained in taxonomic lists and provides several functions for the
manipulation of objects belonging to this class.
