This package provides an object class for containing taxonomic lists. Lists of
taxa (e.g. plant species) may be a list of accepted names but can optionally
contain synonyms, taxonomic ranks, parent-child relationships, taxon traits,
etc.

The object `taxlist` attempts to validate the congruency of information
contained in taxonomic lists and provides several functions for the manipulation
of objects belonging to this class.
